# 🌍 Global Sales Intelligence Dashboard — A Real-World Analytics Case Study

Welcome to one of the most complete Power BI projects I’ve built — not just a dashboard, but a full-stack showcase of data modeling, business storytelling, and actionable insight generation. This case study simulates a real-world sales dataset with over $2.9B in transactions, analyzing global performance across products, regions, and manufacturers.

> **Built with purpose. Structured with care. Designed to communicate real value.**

## 🎯 Project Goals

The goal was to analyze global product sales across seven countries to answer questions like:

- Which markets are truly driving revenue growth?
- How do manufacturers differ in price vs. volume performance?
- What product trends and regional patterns are emerging over time?
- Where are the opportunities for smarter pricing or market expansion?

## 🧠 What This Project Shows

This isn’t a drag-and-drop dashboard. Here's what I focused on:

| Skill | How It's Shown |
|-------|----------------|
| 📊 Data Modeling | Clean star schema, dimension linking, custom DAX time table |
| 📈 KPI Design | Dynamic metrics for Revenue, Units, Avg. Price |
| 📍 Storytelling | Page-level insights, color psychology by country, smart slicers |
| 💡 Business Thinking | Strategic recommendations on pricing & region targeting |
| 🛠️ Real Tool Use | Power BI + DAX + Excel mock data, all integrated cleanly |
